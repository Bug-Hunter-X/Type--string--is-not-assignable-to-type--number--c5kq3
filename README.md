# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: type mismatch between function parameters and arguments. The function `add` is defined to take two numbers as input, but the code calls it with a number and a string, leading to a type error.

The solution demonstrates type checking and type guarding techniques to prevent this error.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `tsc` to compile the TypeScript code.
